# insurance-statistic
some EDA but mainly using statistical method

# project highlights:
- using conditional probability
- measuring covariance and correlation
- null hypothesis testing (what test should be used, interpreting the result, etc)
- a little bit exploration on Bayes Theorem using this dataset (seperate discussion, attached on the pdf)

# Theme:

Im gonna assume that I work in health-tech or insurance companies, and I want *confirm* that the risk of being overweight or smoking will leads to higher medical cost, which we need to charge higher premium, set up internal quota or allow more liquidity into the treasury if we saw a certain high-risk individual growing in proportions

original dataset will be uploaded here as well, please find the ```insurance.csv```

To see the analysis, please start on the:
1. ```insurance - descriptive analysis``` containing the initial exploration of the dataset
2. ```insurance - discrete & continous analysis``` containing analysis of conditional probability of the categorical variables (mostly BMI, medical charges and smoking)
3. ```insurance - correlation, covariance and hypothesis testing``` containing the last leg of the analysis: measuring low / weak relationship between variables
